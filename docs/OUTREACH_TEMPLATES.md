## Messaging Strategy

### Opening Line Rules
✅ **Good:**
- "I saw your post about reducing electricity costs..."
- "Your home in [neighborhood] looks perfect for solar..."
- "Most people don't know they could save 5M VND/month..."

❌ **Bad:**
- "You might be interested in solar..." (too generic)
- "I'm offering a 50% discount..." (they'll think it's spam)
- "Hello, are you looking for solar?" (no personalization)

### Key Selling Points
**Always mention:**
1. **Cost saving** (numbers: 3-5M VND/month)
2. **Quick ROI** (~3-4 years payback)
3. **Time-bound action** (limited slots, quote expires, etc.)
4. **Social proof** (50+ customers, 25-year warranty, etc.)

### Call to Action
**Always end with:**
- Clear next step (fill quote / call me / site visit)
- Time-bound (this week / next 3 days)
- Low barrier entry ("5 minutes", "free", "no obligation")

## Conversation Starters

**What to say when they message back:**

**They asked:** "How much does it cost?"
```
Cost depends on your usage. Most homes:
- 5 kWp: 85 million VND
- 10 kWp: 160 million VND
- 15 kWp: 230 million VND

Quick quote takes 5 min: [link]

What's your monthly electricity bill? That'll help me estimate better.
```

**They asked:** "How long does installation take?"
```
Great question.
- Design & approval: 1 week
- Install & testing: 3-5 days
- Total: 2-4 weeks from contract

Summer (dry season) is fastest.
When were you thinking of starting?
```

**They asked:** "Is it worth it if I use mostly AC at night?"
```
Actually, that's perfect for solar + batteries:
- Day: Solar runs most appliances
- Night: Battery or grid runs AC

This combo gives best savings. Would you be interested in learning more?
```

**They asked:** "I'm too busy to discuss now"
```
Totally understand.

Just save this quote for later: [PDF link]

No rush. When you're ready (even in 3 months), just ping me.
We keep quotes current for 6 months. 😊
```

## Closing Scripts

### When They're Ready to Buy

```
Awesome! 🎉 Let's make this happen.

Here's what we do next:

1. **Sign contract** (digital signature, same day)
   - You approve final quote & timeline

2. **Pay deposit** (60% of total cost)
   - Bank transfer or Zalo Pay
   - Takes 5 minutes

3. **Schedule install** (2-4 weeks out)
   - We'll confirm date once payment clears
   - Installation takes 3-5 days

4. **We handle everything else** ✅
   - Permits (we do)
   - Grid connection (we do)
   - Testing & monitoring (we do)

Ready to get started? When can we sign?
```

### If Budget is Concern

```
I get it - 160M is real money.

Here are options:

**Option 1: Smaller system (5 kWp)**
- Cost: 85 million VND (47% cheaper)
- Savings: 2-2.5M VND/month (still great!)
- Payback: 3.5 years

**Option 2: Add batteries later**
- Start with grid-tied system (160M)
- Add battery storage in 2-3 years (50M more)
- Gives backup power when ready

**Option 3: Payment plan**
- Down payment: 50M now
- 3 years of payments: ~36.7M/year
- Total stays same cost

Which of these makes sense for you?
```

### If They're Hesitating

```
I hear you - big decision.

Common concerns I hear:
1. "Will panels really last 25 years?" → Yes, 25-year warranty (industry standard)
2. "What if panels get old?" → Degradation is only ~0.8%/year (after 25 years still 80% output)
3. "Can I move the system?" → Yes, costs ~15% but possible
4. "What about maintenance?" → Almost zero - just rain cleans them

What's your main concern? I'm happy to dig deeper.

Or: Take 48 hours to think about it. I'll follow up Thursday.
Sound good?
