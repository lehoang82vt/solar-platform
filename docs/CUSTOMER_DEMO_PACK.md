## Common Questions

**Q: How long does installation take?**
A: 2-4 weeks from contract signature. Usually 3-5 days of actual work on your roof.

**Q: Do I need batteries?**
A: Not required. Grid-tied systems are cheaper. Batteries cost extra but give you backup power.

**Q: What if my roof isn't big enough?**
A: We'll design a smaller system. Even 5 kWp saves 2+ million VND/year.

**Q: What about rainy days?**
A: Systems still generate power. Just less. Average Vietnam gets 300+ sunny days/year.

**Q: Can I expand later?**
A: Yes. Most systems can add more panels later (15-20% cost premium).

**Q: What if I sell my house?**
A: System increases home value. Buyer takes over contract or we relocate it.
