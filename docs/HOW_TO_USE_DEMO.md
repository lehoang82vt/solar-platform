## Step 2: Fill Out Survey (5 minutes)

**If you clicked the link above, here's what you'll see:**

### A. Location Details
- City/Province
- District
- (Uses this to check installation team availability)

### B. Roof Details (Most Important)
```
For each roof section where you want solar:
- Azimuth (direction it faces)
  * 180° = South (best)
  * 90° = West
  * 270° = East
  * 0° = North (avoid if possible)
- Tilt (roof angle)
  * 15-35° = ideal for Vietnam
  * Flat roof = usually 20°
- Area (in square meters)
  * Measure length × width
  * Don't count shaded areas
```

### C. Electricity Usage
```
Monthly consumption:
- Check your latest electricity bill
- Look for "kWh" or "số điện tiêu thụ"
- Example: 400 kWh/month

Day usage percentage:
- How much power do you use during daytime?
- 40% day / 60% night = typical home
- 70% day / 30% night = typical business
```

### D. Equipment Preferences (Optional)
```
Do you want batteries?
- No = cheaper, grid-tied system
- Yes = expensive but backup power during outages

Preferred brands? (Usually doesn't matter)
- We'll recommend best value
```

## Common Usage Questions

### Q: I don't know my roof azimuth. What do I do?

**A:** Easy options:
1. Use Google Maps satellite view + compass
2. Watch where the sun hits your roof
   - Morning light = facing East (90°)
   - Afternoon light = facing West (270°)
   - All day light = facing South (180°)
3. Just estimate - we'll measure precisely on site visit

### Q: How accurate is the demo quote?

**A:** Very accurate for design, ±5-10% on price because:
- Uses Google satellite data for sun exposure
- Quotes current equipment prices (updated weekly)
- Final price confirmed on site visit (usually same ±5%)

### Q: Can I edit the quote after?

**A:** Yes! We can:
- Add/remove panels (change from 20 to 30 panels, etc.)
- Add/remove batteries
- Change inverter size
- Adjust tilt angle after site visit

### Q: Do I need to be at home for the site visit?

**A:** Yes. We need to:
- Check roof condition & safety
- Measure exact dimensions
- Check electrical panel location
- Get approval for placement
- Takes about 1-2 hours

### Q: What if my quote is too expensive?

**A:** Common solutions:
1. **Smaller system** - 5 kWp instead of 10 kWp
   - Costs less upfront (80M instead of 155M)
   - Still saves 2+ million VND/year
2. **Add batteries later** - Buy grid-tied system now, add storage in 5 years
3. **Payment plans** - Discuss with our team (some partners offer 3-5 year financing)
